# Introduction

In this project I look at records from data-related job postings in 2023, gather insights that would benefit potential job-seekers, and publish them in an interactive dashboard. 

### Questions I wanted to answer:

1. What are the highest paying jobs? 
2. What skills are required for these jobs? 
3. What are the best companies in terms of job postings and average salary? 
4. In general, what are the most in demand skills?
5. In general, what skills recieve better compensation? 
6. What could be an optimal skillset for a job-seeker?

I have considered all these questions in terms of: 
- Job role
- Remote vs Onsite
- Job location (Country)

# Tools

- **SQL:** 
- **VSCode:**
- **PowerBI:**
